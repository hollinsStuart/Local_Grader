# Local Grader

This is a Python program that allows you to run multiple local test cases for your code with only one line of code.

```linux
python3 Local_Grader.py
```

# Prerequisites

## A ***Python 3*** interpreter in your environment

Python 3 in **WSL** is recommended because we are running Linux commands. 



# How to use

Take EECS 281 Project 2a as a quick example:

0. Install `python3`.
1. Download `examples/p2a-test.py` into your project directory.
2. Run the following command.

```
python3 p2a-test.py
```

The output files will be `*-ans.txt` in the current directory.
